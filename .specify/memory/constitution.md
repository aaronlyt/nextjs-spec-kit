# Novel Writer Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence

All code MUST adhere to strict quality standards to ensure maintainability and reliability. Code MUST be readable, well-documented, and follow established patterns for the chosen technology stack. Every module MUST have a single, clear responsibility and minimal dependencies. Code reviews MUST focus on clarity, testability, and adherence to established patterns. Complex logic MUST be broken down into smaller, testable functions with descriptive names.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves developer velocity, and enables long-term maintenance without technical debt accumulation.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY for all features. Tests MUST be written before implementation code, ensuring they fail initially. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be strictly followed: write failing test, implement minimal code to pass, then refactor. Each user story MUST have independently verifiable tests that can validate functionality in isolation. Integration tests MUST cover user workflows, while unit tests MUST cover individual components and edge cases.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are clearly understood, provides regression safety, and results in better-designed, more maintainable code.

### III. User Experience Consistency

User interface and interactions MUST be consistent across the entire application. Design patterns, terminology, and workflows MUST follow established conventions. User actions MUST provide immediate, clear feedback. Error messages MUST be human-readable and actionable. The application MUST support accessibility standards and be usable across different devices and screen sizes. User preferences MUST be preserved and respected across sessions.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, and makes the application more accessible to new users.

### IV. Performance-First Design

Performance MUST be considered from the beginning of feature development, not added as an afterthought. The application MUST respond to user interactions within 100ms for perceived instant feedback. File operations, especially for large novel documents, MUST complete within acceptable timeframes with progress indicators. Memory usage MUST remain reasonable even with large documents. Background operations MUST not block the user interface. Critical paths MUST be identified and optimized.

**Rationale**: Novel writers work with large documents and need smooth, responsive interactions to maintain creative flow without technical interruptions.

### V. Observable and Debuggable

The application MUST provide comprehensive logging and observability features. User actions and system events MUST be logged appropriately for debugging. Error conditions MUST provide sufficient context for diagnosis. The application MUST support different logging levels for development vs. production. Performance metrics MUST be available to identify bottlenecks. All features MUST be traceable from user action to system response.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive observability enables rapid issue identification and resolution, ensuring reliable operation for users' creative work.

## Quality Gates

All changes MUST pass automated quality gates before integration. Code MUST meet style guidelines and pass static analysis. Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds for critical paths. Performance benchmarks MUST NOT regress. Documentation MUST be updated for all user-facing changes. Security scanning MUST pass without critical vulnerabilities.

**Rationale**: Automated quality gates ensure consistent standards and prevent regressions that could impact users' creative work.

## Development Workflow

All features MUST follow the established workflow: specification → plan → implementation → review → deployment. Each phase MUST have clear acceptance criteria and artifacts. Code reviews MUST be conducted by at least one other developer. User-facing changes MUST include appropriate documentation updates. Features MUST be tested in realistic scenarios with actual novel content before release.

**Rationale**: A structured workflow ensures quality, predictability, and alignment with user needs.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All team members MUST understand and follow these principles in their daily work. Amendments to this constitution require documented rationale, team approval, and updated documentation. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complex decisions MUST reference specific constitution principles to justify approach. Use runtime guidance documents for detailed implementation of these principles.

**Compliance**: Regular reviews MUST be conducted to ensure adherence to these principles. Violations MUST be documented with justification and improvement plans.
