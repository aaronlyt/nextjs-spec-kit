# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME] - Next.js Full-Stack

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (optional - for user story priorities)

**Framework**: Next.js [version] with [App/Pages] Router
**Architecture**: [Rendering strategy from plan]
**Tests**: React Testing Library + Playwright (OPTIONAL - only if explicitly requested)

**Organization**: Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact Next.js file paths in descriptions

## Next.js Path Conventions
- **App Router**: `app/`, `app/api/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `types/`
- **Pages Router**: `pages/`, `pages/api/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `types/`
- **Database**: `prisma/`, `lib/db.ts`
- **Styles**: `styles/globals.css`, `components/` with CSS Modules or Tailwind

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.

  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Architecture decisions from plan.md
  - Components, APIs, and database schema from plan.md
  - Rendering strategies and routing from plan.md

  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment

  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in README.md
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in __tests__/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening (CSRF, XSS protection, etc.)




## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Database & Infrastructure (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Database & Infrastructure phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Optimization (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Within Each User Story

1. **Database First**: Models and migrations before any other work
2. **Types**: TypeScript interfaces immediately after models
3. **API Before UI**: API routes must exist before components can connect
4. **Components Before Pages**: Build components, then assemble into pages
5. **Integration Last**: Connect everything together with error handling

### Parallel Opportunities Within Each Story

- All tests marked `[P]` can run in parallel (write first, ensure they fail)
- Database models can run in parallel (if no relationships)
- TypeScript types can run in parallel with API development
- Components can run in parallel (if no shared dependencies)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members



## Next.js Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Next.js Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Database & Infrastructure (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 with full Next.js patterns
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy MVP to Vercel/staging

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Database Infrastructure ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Database Infrastructure together
2. Once Database Infrastructure is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Frontend focus)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (API focus)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Database focus)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently



## Next.js-Specific Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Rendering Strategy**: Follow the CSR/SSR/SSG decisions from plan.md exactly
- **API Routes**: Use Next.js App Router API patterns (`app/api/*/route.ts`)
- **Database**: Always use Prisma migrations, never manual database changes
- **Validation**: Client + server validation using Zod schemas
- **State Management**: Use useState/Context as decided in plan.md
- **Styling**: Consistent with chosen approach (Tailwind/CSS Modules)
- **Testing**: RTL for components, Jest for API, Playwright for E2E
- **Error Handling**: Next.js error boundaries and proper API error responses
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
